    This training is designed for those starting up or currently leading open projects– project leads, partners, or small groups of co-leaders responsible for project success and growth.

To create this training, we drew on our many years of experience leading open projects.

    The training consists of nine sections, each containing a set of modules on a topic related to working open. In each module, you’ll learn by reading, watching short videos created by Mozilla staff and community members, and completing hands-on assignments. The assignments build on each other, so this training works best if you do the modules in order. The nine sections are:
